Python bindings to the OpenStack Nova API
==================================================

This is a client for the OpenStack Nova API. There's a Python API (the
``novaclient`` module), and a command-line script (``nova``). Each
implements 100% of the OpenStack Nova API.

[PENDING] `Full documentation is available`__.

__ http://packages.python.org/python-novaclient/

You'll also probably want to read `Rackspace's API guide`__ (PDF) -- the first
bit, at least -- to get an idea of the concepts. Rackspace is doing the cloud
hosting thing a bit differently from Amazon, and if you get the concepts this
library should make more sense.

Development takes place on GitHub__. Bug reports and patches may be filed there.

__ https://github.com/rackspace/python-client

This code a fork of `Jacobian's python-cloudservers`__ If you need API support
for the Rackspace API soley or the BSD license, you should use that repository. 
python-client is licensed under the Apache License like the rest of OpenStack.

Command-line API
----------------

Installing this package gets you a shell command, ``nova``, that you
can use to interact with any Rackspace compatible API (including OpenStack).

You'll need to provide your OpenStack username and API key. You can do this
with the ``--username`` and ``--apikey`` params, but it's easier to just 
set them as environment variables::

    export NOVA_USERNAME=openstack
    export NOVA_API_KEY=yadayada

You will also need to define the authentication url with ``--url``. Or set it as
an environment variable as well::

    export NOVA_URL=http://myserver:port/v1.0/
    
You'll find complete documentation on the shell by running 
``nova help``::
    
    usage: nova [--username USERNAME] [--apikey APIKEY] 
                        [--url AUTH_URL] <subcommand> ...

Python API
----------

[PENDING] There's also a `complete Python API`__.

__ http://packages.python.org/python-novaclient/

By way of a quick-start::

    >>> import novaclient
    >>> nt = novaclient.OpenStack(USERNAME, API_KEY [, AUTH_URL])
    >>> nt.flavors.list()
    [...]
    >>> nt.servers.list()
    [...]
    >>> s = nt.servers.create(image=2, flavor=1, name='myserver')
    
    ... time passes ...
    
    >>> s.reboot()
    
    ... time passes ...
    
    >>> s.delete()

What's new?
