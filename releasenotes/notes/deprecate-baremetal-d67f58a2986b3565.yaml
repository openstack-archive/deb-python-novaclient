    The following CLIs and python API bindings are now deprecated for removal:

    * nova baremetal-node-list
    * nova baremetal-node-show
    * nova baremetal-interface-list

    These will be removed in the first major python-novaclient release after
    the Nova 15.0.0 Ocata release. Use python-ironicclient or
    python-openstackclient for CLI and python-ironicclient or openstacksdk
    for python API bindings.
