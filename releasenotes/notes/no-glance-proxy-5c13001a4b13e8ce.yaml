    The 2.36 microversion deprecated the image proxy API. As such, CLI calls
    now directly call the image service to get image details, for example,
    as a convenience to boot a server with an image name rather than the image
    id. To do this the following is assumed:

    #. There is an **image** entry in the service catalog.
    #. The image v2 API is available.
