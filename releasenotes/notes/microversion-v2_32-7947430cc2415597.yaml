    The 2.32 microverison adds support for virtual device
    role tagging. Device role tagging is an answer to the
    question 'Which device is which?' from inside the guest.
    When booting an instance, an optional arbitrary 'tag'
    parameter can be set on virtual network interfaces
    and/or block device mappings. This tag is exposed to the
    instance through the metadata API and on the config
    drive. Each tagged virtual network interface is listed
    along with information about the virtual hardware, such
    as bus type (ex: PCI), bus address (ex: 0000:00:02.0),
    and MAC address. For tagged block devices, the exposed
    hardware metadata includes the bus (ex: SCSI), bus
    address (ex: 1:0:2:0) and serial number.

    In the client, device tagging is exposed with the 'tag'
    key in the --block-device and --nic boot arguments.

    While not an issue with the client itself, it should be
    noted that if a tagged network interface or volume is
    detached from a guest, its metadata will continue to
    appear in the config drive, even after instance reboot.
