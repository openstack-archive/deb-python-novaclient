    The 2.37 microversion is now supported. This introduces the following
    changes:

    * CLI: The **--nic** value for the **nova boot** command now takes two
           special values, 'auto' and 'none'. If --nic is not specified, the
           CLI defaults to 'auto'.
    * Python API: The **nics** kwarg is required when creating a server using
           the *novaclient.v2.servers.ServerManager.create* API. The **nics**
           value can be a list of dicts or a string with value 'auto' or
           'none'.

    With the 2.37 microversion, the **nics** kwarg is required when creating
    a server using the *novaclient.v2.servers.ServerManager.create* API. The
    **nics** value can be a list of dicts or an enum string with one of the
    following values:

    * **auto**: This tells the Compute service to automatically allocate a
      network for the project if one is not available and then associate
      an IP from that network with the server. This is the same behavior as
      passing nics=None before the 2.37 microversion.
    * **none**: This tells the Compute service to not allocate any networking
      for the server.
