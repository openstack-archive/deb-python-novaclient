    The 2.36 microversion deprecated the network proxy APIs in
    Nova. Because of this we now go directly to neutron for name to
    net-id lookups. For nova-net deployements the old proxies will
    continue to be used.

    To do this the following is assumed:

    #. There is a **network** entry in the service catalog.
    #. The network v2 API is available.
