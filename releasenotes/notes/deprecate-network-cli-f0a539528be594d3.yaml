upgrade:
  - |
    The ability to update the following network-related resources via the
    ``nova quota-update`` and ``nova quota-class-update`` commands is now
    deprecated:

    * Fixed IPs
    * Floating IPs
    * Security Groups
    * Security Group Rules

    By default the quota and limits CLIs will not update or show those
    resources using microversion >= 2.36. You can still use them, however, by
    specifying ``--os-compute-api-version 2.35``. Quota information for network
    resources should be retrieved from python-neutronclient or
    python-openstackclient.
deprecations:

    The following commands are now deprecated:

    * dns-create
    * dns-create-private-domain
    * dns-create-public-domain
    * dns-delete
    * dns-delete-domain
    * dns-domains
    * dns-list
    * fixed-ip-get
    * fixed-ip-reserve
    * fixed-ip-unreserve
    * floating-ip-create
    * floating-ip-delete
    * floating-ip-list
    * floating-ip-pool-list
    * floating-ip-bulk-create
    * floating-ip-bulk-delete
    * floating-ip-bulk-list
    * network-create
    * network-delete
    * network-disassociate
    * network-associate-host
    * network-associate-project
    * network-list
    * network-show
    * scrub
    * secgroup-create
    * secgroup-delete
    * secgroup-list
    * secgroup-update
    * secgroup-add-group-rule
    * secgroup-delete-group-rule
    * secgroup-add-rule
    * secgroup-delete-rule
    * secgroup-list-rules
    * secgroup-list-default-rules
    * secgroup-add-default-rule
    * secgroup-delete-default-rule
    * tenant-network-create
    * tenant-network-delete
    * tenant-network-list
    * tenant-network-show

    With the 2.36 microversion these will fail in the API. The CLI will
    fallback to passing the 2.35 microversion to ease the transition. Network
    resource information should be retrieved from python-neutronclient or
    python-openstackclient.
